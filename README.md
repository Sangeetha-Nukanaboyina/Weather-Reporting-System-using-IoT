# Weather-Reporting-System-using-IoT
Project Summary: A top-tier IoT project, the Weather Report system provides localized forecasts, minimizing reliance on external agencies. Utilizing temperature, humidity, and rain sensors, the system reports real-time statistics online through the Internet. It also allows setting alerts—red, yellow, and green—to identify and warn of extreme events like volcanoes, tsunamis, heavy rainfall, ensuring timely responses to potential calamities.
